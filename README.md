# Circuit-Solver

# Commands
- `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to view project in the browser.
- `jest` to run tests

# Credits
- This project uses a modified version of [Maxwell](http://web.psung.name/maxwell/) by Phil Sung to model circuits and calculate voltages.

# Issues/Improvements
- When an element is rotated, the board recalculates its entire power distribution from scratch, potentially doing some unnecessary work
