# Circuit-Solver

# Credits
- This project uses a modified version of [Maxwell](http://web.psung.name/maxwell/) by Phil Sung to model the circuit and calculate voltages.

# Issues/Improvements
- When an element is rotated, the board recalculates its entire power distribution from scratch, potentially doing some unnecessary work
