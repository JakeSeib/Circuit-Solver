# Design Decisions
- DC circuits only
- Not creating complete freedom to design any circuit- instead, limited number of editable nodes in a preconstructed circuit (hence, more of a puzzle to solve than an engineering task)
- Preconstructed circuit has one or more nodes with a desired voltage
- Circuits can have multiple stages to solve; circuit design/parameters change after one stage is solved

# Circuit elements
- Choose between wire and special component
  - Special components: resistor, capacitor, diode
  - Wire
- Both wire and special components
  - choose different directions to connect; only one direction can be connected (no multi-connections can be chosen)
  - also can choose to disconnect
