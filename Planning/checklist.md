# Circuit Page
[] Circuit component
  [] Represent a circuit in a data structure
  [] Calculate voltage at point of interest on circuit
  [] Calculate voltage at multiple points of interest on circuit
  [] Represent a circuit visually (on a predefined grid, does not need to be of variable dimensions)
[] Circuit-chooser component
  [x] Choose between wire or resistor
  [x] Choose directions to connect (horizontal or vertical)
  [] Visual representation of type and direction

# Site Architecture
[] Accept passwords to unlock sections of site/additonal puzzle stages

# Stretch Goals
[] Include diodes as potential components
[] Include capacitors as potential components
[] Include "diagonal" directions (i.e. left connected to top)
